The Joker Model skin by V-bros Inc.
Vnitro@worldnet.att.net

Used G-man to change the suit color and face. This is our 2nd model
with more to come.  we're having fun doing em too!  ;-)

Skin info:

chrome: no 
Hue shift: yes
animation: unmodified Valve anims

Re-mapped skin using Mdlviewer v2.1.0402, and re-colored it in Adobe PhotoShop 5.

To use, extract the .zip file (Joker.bmp and Joker.mdl) into valve/models/player/Joker/

More cool and new character skins are on the way! 

Thanks, Bob V. and Frank V.
