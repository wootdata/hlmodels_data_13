365 kbytes and 941 polygons of pure skin, baby.  Shock your enemies as a beautiful, disrobed woman in your multiplayer Half-Life games!



NOTE: If you are offended by nudity or are not supposed to view such materials, do not install this model.  Otherwise, happy holidays!



Installation:

To use this model, unzip it into the "valve/models/players" directory in your Half-Life folder.  All these files should then be in a folder named "nympho".



This model will eventually be used in an upcoming mod, resembling Counterstrike, but rather a fight between college students and Housing and Dining Services.  There will be nude models as the "hostages".  I will be doing all the 3d artwork for this mod.



I have also made a 2D overhead space combat game, Star Havoc.  It's great.  To download it, go to the SquireSoft homepage below.
